# Todo Application

This is a simple Todo application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add and delete todo items, which are stored in a JSON file.

## Features

- Add new todo items
- Delete existing todo items
- Todos are stored in a JSON file for persistence

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
- `styles.css`: Provides styling for the application.
- `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for adding, deleting, and storing todos.
- `todos.json`: Stores the todo items in JSON format.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a todo item in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
3. Click "Delete" next to a todo item to remove it from the list.

## Setup

Ensure you have a local server running to handle the JSON file operations, as direct file manipulation is not supported in most browsers due to security restrictions.
